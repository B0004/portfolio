A) Specifying the identity of client is often crucial in determining a government lawyer’s
responsibilities. MR 1.13 provides that a lawyer employed by an organization “represents the
organization acting through its duly authorized constituents,” and the rule applies to lawyers
employed by governmental entities. But the comment [par. 9] notes that “defining the identity of
the client and prescribing the resulting obligations of such lawyers” may be “more difficult in the
government context.” The commentary on the “Muslim ban” controversy and proposed new
language in the D.C. Bar’s comment to Rule 1.13 explain that the Attorney General and
Department of Justice lawyers represent the United States. The President, who is the elected head
of the executive branch, presumptively speaks on behalf of the United States even if she is not the
only “constituent” with authority to make decisions for “the client”. The AG’s duties include giving
advice to the President and the rest of the Executive Branch and representing the United States in
legal matters generally. As explored in Chapter 21 and during the speaker panel on government
practice, lawyers for government entities often face an “agency problem” in determining whether
the individuals who purport to speak for the client are acting in the best interests of the
governmental entity. This can be extremely challenging. On the one hand, the legitimacy of the
President and Executive Branch officials depends on being responsive to democratic and political
processes. On the other hand, the personal interests and political ambitions of these actors can
interfere with their authority to speak for the client. Agassi should respond to the question by
explaining that the lawyers in his office represent the United States, not the President in her
personal capacity, and that advancing the President’s personal political fortunes is not part of their
job. But in actual practice, implementing this formal description of the responsibilities of lawyers
in the AG’s office is no simple matter.
